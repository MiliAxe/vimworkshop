# VimWorkshop slides

This repository contains the slides for a Vim Workshop I held at IUST

## Viewing the slides

There is a `compile.sh` script included for "compiling" the slides.
The slides are meant to be converted to other formats with `pandoc`.
I used the reveal.js format to experiment with reveal.js for the slides.
You should be able to convert it to beamer pdf format too with a little bit
of gimmicking.

## Credits

- The slides are heavily inspired by the great vim tutorial [iggredible/Learn-Vim](https://github.com/iggredible/Learn-Vim).
- Also, huge thanks to this great [gist](https://gist.github.com/jsoma/629b9564af5b1e7fa62d0a3a0a47c296) for teaching me how to use pandoc + reveal.js.
